# Contributing to Gssoc FAQ

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels, including participants in GSSoC'25 (GirlScript Summer of Code 2025) and the broader open-source community.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Navigate to the main repository page on GitHub
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork
Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
cd REPOSITORY-NAME
```

### Step 3: Create a New Branch
Always create a new branch for your work. Never commit directly to the main branch:
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Use descriptive branch names like:
- `feature/add-login-page`
- `fix/navbar-responsive-issue`
- `docs/update-readme`

### Step 4: Make Your Changes
- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style and structure
- Test your changes thoroughly before committing
- Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality

### Step 5: Commit Your Changes
Write clear and meaningful commit messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
```

Good commit message examples:
- `Add user authentication feature`
- `Fix responsive design issue in header`
- `Update documentation for API endpoints`

Avoid vague messages like:
- `Update`
- `Fix bug`
- `Changes made`

### Step 6: Push Your Changes
Push your branch to your forked repository:
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Fill out the pull request template with all required information
4. Add a clear title and description of your changes
5. Link the related issue using keywords like `Closes #issue-number` or `Fixes #issue-number`
6. Attach proof of work (screenshots or videos showing before/after changes)
7. Submit the pull request

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Required Information
Every pull request must include:
- Clear title describing the change
- Detailed description of what was changed and why

### Before Submitting
- Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards
- Test all functionality affected by your changes
- Update documentation if you are adding new features
- Make sure your branch is up to date with the main branch

### Commit Message Guidelines
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Provide additional details in the body if necessary
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

### Code Review Process

## Types of Contributions

### Bug Reports
- Use the issue tracker to report bugs
- Describe the bug clearly with steps to reproduce
- Include screenshots or error messages if applicable
- Specify your environment (OS, browser, version)

### Feature Requests
- Submit feature requests through the issue tracker
- Clearly describe the feature and its benefits
- Explain why this feature would be useful to the project

### Code Contributions
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- GSSoC'25 participants should look for issues labeled `Gssoc2025`
- Always discuss major changes in an issue before starting work

### Documentation
- Improve existing documentation
- Add examples and clarifications
- Fix typos and grammatical errors
- Ensure documentation stays up to date with code changes

## Testing Guidelines

Before submitting your pull request:
1. Test all new features thoroughly
2. Verify that existing functionality is not broken
3. Test on different browsers/devices if applicable
4. Include screenshots or videos demonstrating the changes

## Getting Help

If you need help or have questions:
- Check existing documentation and issues
- Comment on the related issue for clarification
- Reach out to maintainers through issue comments
- Be patient and respectful when seeking assistance

## Using the new interactive Issue forms

We now provide interactive GitHub Issue Forms to make filing bugs, feature requests, and questions easier and more structured. To create a new issue:

1. Click the repository's "New issue" button on GitHub.
2. Choose the appropriate form: "Bug report", "Feature request", or "Question / Support".
3. Fill the required fields in the form â€” required fields will prevent submission until completed.

These forms automatically apply labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`) to help maintainers triage incoming reports. If you prefer the old templates, legacy copies are preserved in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/legacy/`.

## Important Notes

- Do not submit AI-generated code without understanding and reviewing it
- Ensure your contributions are original or properly attributed
