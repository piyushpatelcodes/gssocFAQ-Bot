They review PRs and answer contributor questions when needed. - Mentors support on demand and not assigned per contributor. \n\n **`Project Admins`**: Lead and manage each project. They coordinate with mentors, review progress, and ensure project quality. They mark the labels with *gssoc2025* and *level 1/2/3*. Please reach out to them by mentioning their GitHub ID in issue or PR comments, or by contacting them on Discord.
