This repository now uses interactive GitHub Issue Forms for bug reports and feature requests.

Please use the 'New issue' button in GitHub and select the appropriate form (Bug report, Feature request or Question) to submit structured information. These forms include required fields and will automatically add labels to help triage.

Legacy templates are kept in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/legacy/` if you need them.
